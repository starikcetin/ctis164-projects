DONE
#####
* (2pts) Display a label (your name, surname, “HOMEWORK #4” text) and a proper title for window.
* Do not create a window larger than 1400x800 pixels.
* (13pts) Display a bottom bar that shows the status of light sources (ON or OFF). F1, F2, F3 and F4 keys are used to switch their states.
* (5pts) F5 key should pause/start the animation.
* (5pts) F6 key should restart the animation by assigning new random values to the global variables.
* (20pts) Draw a white sun and at least two planets rotating in different orbits around the sun. Use random values for the radius, rotation speed and rotation direction of the planets.
* (15pts) Display three lights: red, green and blue. They move (with different velocities) in the scene, and they reflect from borders.
* (40pts) Calculate lighting effect of all active light sources (three lights and the sun) on the planets.

REQUIRED TODO
#####




Restrictions:
* Use “vec.h” and “vec.cpp” header files that are available on the moodle page.
* In your program, you will use three lights and at least two planets. Declare two structure arrays for the lights and the planets. In your code, access and use these objects in loops. Otherwise your grade will be reduced by 40 points.




RECOMMENDED TODO
#####
Hints:
* When drawing a planet, use GL_TRIANGLE_FAN, the color of the first vertex (center point) is black (or dark grey if you want this planet to be seen when deactivated), and for the vertices on the circle, calculate their colors using lighting calculation.
* Find below calculation of the Normal vector (N) of a vertex on the circle:




OPTIONAL TODO
#####
Bonus Points: After completing these basics, you can make any improvements to your program as you wish. You will get bonus points according to your creativity and your programming skills. But, you have to list these improvements in the beginning of your source code as comment lines. Additional functions that are not reported in the source code, will not get any bonus points.


----------------------------------------------

Important Notes:
* Name your source code as YourSurname_Name.cpp.
* At the beginning of your source code include a comment block containing your name, student number, section, problems in your program and additional functionalities, if any. If your program does not meet the minimum requirements, explain them in the PROBLEMS section of the given template source code.
* Use comment lines in your program, when necessary.
* Do not upload all project files. Do not upload a zip file. Upload only your source code with .cpp extension.
* Your grade will be reduced, if you don’t follow the above rules!
* Source codes that do not compile and run on the lab computers, will not be graded! It is the student’s responsibility to check any compatibility problems before uploading onto moodle.
* If you miss the deadline, you can send your source code via e-mail within 24 hours of the deadline. But your grade will be reduced by 40%.
* Materials sent later than 24 hours after the deadline, will not be graded.
* The snapshot and its executable is given as just an example. You have to design your own simulation.
* Do not copy any part of a friend’s program. You can share ideas but not code. Sharing any part of C source code leads to grade 0.
