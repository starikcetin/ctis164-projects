DONE
#####
- A proper title for window
- Adjust dimensions for window
- Draw x and y axis
- Display a label (your name, surname, “HOMEWORK #3” text)
- Draw at least three concentric orbits.
*- Aim line
*- Aim point
- Design a gun object at the origin.
	> It should contain at least one element that is not a circle or line segment.
	> The user should rotate it by moving the mouse pointer.
	> It should also show the gun’s current angle.

- After clicking mouse left button,
	> game starts
	> and it creates (at least) three circular objects
	> with random color, position, radius and angular speed (clockwise or anticlockwise).

- After game starts, the mouse left button click fires a circular bullet.

- If the bullet hits any of the object, it disappears.

- The game restarts after all objects are destroyed by the player.



DOING

REQUIRED TODO
#####




RECOMMENDED TODO
#####

- You can implement a scoring system, which uses elapsed time and points of the targets.

- You can design a complex target object that will be rotated while travelling in the orbit.

- You can design a complex bullet object that will be rotated according to its angle.

- You can implement multiple bullets.




OPTIONAL TODO
#####

- Make each particle system self-contained
	- Move constant macros into member values

- Muzzle flash for gun

- Reload time (?)

- Gun rotation maximum angular speed

- Assign rotation from update, draw from rotation on draw, currently draw accesses rotation directly

- Draw celestials only when the game is running


----------------------------------------------


Restrictions:
- This is a trigonometry homework. You have to solve the given problem using your trigonometry knowledge. You cannot use vectors or matrices.
- In your program, you will use at least 3 target objects. 
	> Use the same data structure for all the target objects and declare a structure array for them. In your code, access and use these target objects in loops. Otherwise your grade will be reduced by 40 points.

Bonus: After completing these basics, you can make any improvements to your program as you wish. You can design your own game, based on the listed requirements. Find below some possible improvements:
<ADDED TO TODO>
You will get bonus points according to your creativity and your programming skills. But, you have to list these improvements in the beginning of your source code as comment lines. Additional functions that are not reported in the source code, will not get any bonus points.

Important Notes:
- Name your source code as YourName_Surname.cpp.
- At the beginning of your source code include a comment block containing your name, student number, section, problems in your program and additional functionalities, if any.
- Use comment lines in your program.
- Do not upload all project files. Do not upload a zip file. Upload only your source code with .cpp extension.
- Your grade will be reduced, if you don’t follow the above rules!
- Source codes that do not compile and run on the lab computers, will not be graded! It is the student’s responsibility to check any compatibility problems before uploading onto moodle.
- If you miss the deadline, you can send your source code via e-mail within 24 hours of the deadline. But your grade will be reduced by 40%.
- Materials sent later than 24 hours after the deadline, will not be graded.
- The snapshot and its executable is given as just an example. You have to design your own game.
- Do not copy any part of a friend’s program. You can share ideas but not code. Sharing any part of C source code leads to grade 0.
