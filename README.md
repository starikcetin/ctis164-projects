# Projects for CTIS 164
The projects I made for the CTIS 164 - Technical Mathematics with Programming course.

I normally don't like putting everything into a single file, however there was a single-file-only requirement: 
They wanted us to send a single .cpp file only for each project.

You need to have GLUT and OpenGL installed in order to run any of the projects.
